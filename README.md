# Webots Wall Following Robot

This project is a simple wall-following robot simulation built using Webots and programmed in C++. The robot is designed to move forward while maintaining a fixed distance from a wall using its distance sensors. It continuously reads data from the left, right, and front sensors to detect the position of nearby walls or obstacles. Based on these readings, it adjusts the speed of its left and right motors to either move straight, turn slightly, or avoid collisions. The main goal of this project is to understand the basic control logic behind autonomous navigation and sensor-based movement. The code is beginner-friendly and demonstrates how to use the Webots API for motor and sensor control. It is an ideal starting point for learning robot programming and real-time decision-making in C++.
